Mini-Max Sum:
* Time Complexity O(n) because there is a for loop iterating through the full input array, and all other operations are constant.
* Space Complexity O(1) because all of the variables stored are individual values, not data structures, so they take up constant space. 

Hackerrank in a String:
* Time Complecity O(n) because it recursively iterates through each character in the input string s, reducing it by 1 character each time.
* Space Complexity O(mn) because there are two lists being recursed through; In the worst case a new substring is stored each time for each of the two lists.
